While RUM (real user monitoring) monitors timing in browser in real time, synthetic testing provides
lab environment for testing web page as well as recommendation on how to improve performance.

The difference can be summarized as below:

* RUM anwsers "How fast is this page"
* Synthetic tests answer "How to make this page faster"

### Google PageSpeed Chrome Extension

Install google pagespeed chrome extension, and access it from the Chrome DevTool PageSpeed tab.

During page navigation, google pagespeed will give rule-based metrics as well as recomendations (e.g., reduced image files)
which the web page can use to improve performance

### YSlow Chrome Extension

Install yslow chrome extension, and use it to fine tune the page resources and so on, in similar way to PageSpeed

### WebPageTest

The webpagetest.org allow user to specify:
 
* map location (i.e., geographical regions) to perform testing of the web page loading time
* device (e.g., browser, OS and devices)
